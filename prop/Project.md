## Project
I propose to create the first model that couples detailed magnetic dynamo modeling with sophisticated (sub)stellar evolution calculations to study the evolution of dynamo-generated magnetic fields and the remanant magnetic fields that may ultimately produce. Creating a dynamo evolution model and investigating various phenomena is a daunting task. I have therefore split the project into four sub-projects.

### P1 Dynamo Modeling in (sub)Stellar Evolution
Produce the first directly coupled dynamo and stellar evolution model. Develop an interface for passing information, time stepping criteria (adaptive scheme), suitable averaging schemes to return Maxwell stresses. Use to constrain free parameters in stellar model (gamma, f). Initially bypass magnetic wind formalism in flow chart.

### P2 Dynamo Evolution: Key Processes and Uncertainties
(Can be simultaneous with P.1) 
Quite straight forward to throw all of the ingredients into a model and get something that looks qualitatively correct. More difficult to assess the important physical mechanisms and the sensistivity of the results to various modeling choices or physical assumptions. Study how various ingredients in the models affect dynamo processess at various stages of evolution and the consequences for later times. 

(e.g., stellar mass, composition/metallicity, initial conditions, convection treatment, equation of state, rotational velocity, dynamo model free parameters?, feedback vs no feedback)

### P3 Rotational Evolution: Wind Breaking & Angular Momentum Transport
Enabling rotation in the stellar evolution model and tracing rotational evolution through the evolution of large-scale magnetic field topology. Evaluating the impact of various wind breaking formalisms on angular momentum loss. Used to investigate phenomena related to angular momentum evolution: (i) dichotomy of angular momentum evolution in young intermediate and high mass stars (Alecian et al. 2013b), (ii) constant angular momentum for old, solar-type main-sequence stars (van Saders et al. 2016).

### P4 Large-Scale Magnetic Field Topology in Time
Pulling together knowledge learned from P.2 and P.3 to study how magnetic fields evolve with a focus on magnetic fields that exist prior to observed remnant fields. (i) why magnetic intermeidate and high mass stars have an occurrence of only 10% , (ii) why remenant core dynamo fields have a mass-dependent occurrence between 20% - 50% (Stello et al. 2016), (iii) evolutionary scenario proposed by Gregory et al. and link to stellar structure, (iv) how dynamo evolution affects ages of young stellar associations and the general morphology of HR diagrams (Feiden 2016), (v) evolution of differential rotation (Marsden et al., Kepler someone); critical predictions testable by upcoming TESS and PLATO programs. 

### P.5 Cyclic Dynamos and Magnetic Activity Cycles throughout Stellar Evolution
The primary focus of sub-projects P1 through P4 is to investigate how the topology of large-scale dynamo-driven magnetic fields evovle over evolutionary timescales. However, extracting accurate properties magnetic field properties from dynamo simulations for use in stellar evolution calculations requires following the evolution of the magnetic field over timescales of several decades. This is because the large-scale component of dynamo-driven magnetic fields are expected to undergo cyclic polarity reversals. The Sun, for example, undergoes large-scale polarity reversals approximately every 11 years. Similar cycles are observed on other stars (e.g., Petit et al. 2004) with detailed MHD simulations suggesting the process is a ubiquitous feature of magnetic dynamo processes (e.g., Someone et al. Year). As a result, a significant by-product of sub-project P4 will be information about how the frequency of polarity reversals in the large-scale magnetic field throughout star's lifetime.  

Cyclic polarity reversals on the Sun and other stars are accompanied by corresponding cycles in the number and location of sun/starspots and variations in chromospheric emission (e.g., from Ca II H & K; Lockwood et al. 2007). Polarity reversals in the large-scale magnetic field appear to more generally trace magnetic activity cycles in a manner analagous to solar maxima and minima (CITE?). [Connection to UV/Xray, Aurora] Auroral activity on the Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn observed to fluctuate with the solar cycle is the visible manifestation... (Chapman) The flux of high energy radiation and the power of the solar wind have important ramifications for the environment of the early Earth and the development of life.
