# Ages of Young Stars and the Evolution of Dynamo-Generated Magnetic Fields

## Purpose & Aims

## Survey of the Field

## Projects

### P1. Dynamo-Generated Magnetic Fields throughout Early (sub)Stellar Evolution

#### P1.1 Magnetic Fields in Surface Convection Zones of Low- and Intermediate-Mass Stars

#### P1.2 Core Convection in the Presence of Magnetic Fields

#### P1.3 Magnetic Fields in Young Brown Dwarfs and Giant Planets

### P2. Starspots and Atmospheric Considerations

### P3. Fundamental Properties of Young Stars

### P4. Homogeneous Ages for Young Stellar Associations


## Significance
  - Ages of Young Stars
    - protoplanetary disk evolution timescales
    - giant planet formation timescales
    - star formation history, including time dependence of IMF
    - properties of directly imaged planets and brown dwarfs
      - constraints on mass distribution --> formation mechanism
  - Magnetic Field Evolution
    - activity cycles --> astrobiology (stretch?)
    - angular momentum transport and stellar rotational evolution
    - accurate stellar properties
      - ages and masses of single stars
      - properties of transiting extrasolar planets
  - Grid of Stellar Models
    - available to public
    - allows extensive testing of theory

## Preliminary Results
  - Feiden (2016, submitted)
  - Pilot study for the Sun 
  - Pilot study for a low-mass star [?]

## Independent Lines of Research
None thus far?

## International and National Collaborations
  - [Confirmed] Star formation group at UT Austin (Kraus, Rizzuto). Fundamental properties of young stars using B- through M-type EBs in young associations with Kepler/K2. Magnetic fields of young stars with IGRINS.
  - [Confirmed] CALYPSO: Calibration of Low-mass Young stars and their Planetary Systems with Observations (Mann [UT Austin], Gaidos [Hawaii], Ansdell [Hawaii]). Fundamental properties of bona fidé members of nearby young moving groups using "spectro-bolometric techniques."
  - [Option] MDI/ZDI research group at ESO (Hussain, Lavail). Magnetic field topologies for young T-Tauri stars that can be compared against predictions from models in P1 with age information from P3.
  - [Option] MDI/ZDI research group at Uppsala (Kochukhov, Rosén). Magnetic field topologies for young solar analogs in young stellar associations.
  - [Confirmed] Open Cluster collaboration (Silvester, Landstreet). Magnetic field topologies for intermediate mass stars in several young stellar associations.
  - [Option] Disk group at Stockholm (Janson)? Provide models to compute ages of directly imaged extrasolar planets and systems with circumstellar disks.

## Other Grants
Consdiering SNSB. Not likely, though.
