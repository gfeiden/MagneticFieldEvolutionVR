# Ages of Young Stars and the Evolution of Dynamo-Generated Magnetic Fields

## Purpose & Aims

## Survey of the Field

## Projects

### P1. Dynamo-Generated Magnetic Fields throughout Early (sub)Stellar Evolution
Primary focus is coupling 1D stellar evolution model to a 2D mean-field dynamo model. [NORDITA] 
Comparison against observations of stellar magnetic fields. [Uppsala; ESO; UT Austin]

#### P1.1 Magnetic Fields in Surface Convection Zones of Low- and Intermediate-Mass Stars

#### P1.2 Core Convection in the Presence of Magnetic Fields

#### P1.3 Magnetic Fields in Young Brown Dwarfs and Giant Planets

### P2. Starspots and Atmospheric Considerations
Exploring the impact of starspots on observable properties (preliminary: Feiden & Christophe, in prep). [NORDITA]
Including magnetic fields in stellar atmosphere models to better prescribe surface boundary conditions. [Uppsala]

### P3. Fundamental Properties of Young Stars
Confronting model predictions of young star properties as a function of age using a large number of stars characterized with spectro-bolometric techniques (CALYPSO) and young eclipsing binaries observed by Kepler/K2. [Hawaii; UT Austin]

### P4. Homogeneous Ages for Young Stellar Associations
Deriving homoegenous ages for young stellar associations using available literature data. Provides constraints on a number of interesting astrophysical phenomena. [partially with UT Austin; Stockholm]

## Significance
  - Ages of Young Stars

  - [Confirmed] CALYPSO: Calibration of Low-mass Young stars and their Planetary Systems with Observations (Mann [UT Austin], Gaidos [Hawaii], Ansdell [Hawaii]). Fundamental properties of bona fidé members of nearby young moving groups using "spectro-bolometric techniques."
  - [Option] MDI/ZDI research group at ESO (Hussain, Lavail). Magnetic field topologies for young T-Tauri stars that can be compared against predictions from models in P1 with age information from P3.
  - [Option] MDI/ZDI research group at Uppsala (Kochukhov, Rosén). Magnetic field topologies for young solar analogs in young stellar associations.
  - [Confirmed] Open Cluster collaboration (Silvester, Landstreet). Magnetic field topologies for intermediate mass stars in several young stellar associations.
