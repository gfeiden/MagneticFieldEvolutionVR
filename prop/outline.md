# Ages of Young Stars and the Evolution of Dynamo-Generated Stellar Magnetic Fields

## Purpose & Aims

## Survey of the Field

## Projects

### P1. Dynamo-Generated Magnetic Fields throughout Early (sub)Stellar Evolution
Primary focus is coupling 1D stellar evolution model to a 2D mean-field dynamo model. [NORDITA] 
Comparison against observations of stellar magnetic fields. [Uppsala; ESO; UT Austin]

Three sub-projects:

__P1.1 Magnetic Fields in Surface Convection Zones of Low- and Intermediate-Mass Stars__

Core of project. Evolution of dynamo-generated magnetic fields in stellar convective envelopes. 
How is magnetic topology affected by rotation and the size of the convectie envelope/radiative 
core? How does the evolving topology influence the feedback on stellar structure? When and why
do stars transition from relatively "simple" axisymmetric, dipolar large-scale magnetic fields 
to predominantly non-axisymmetric, complex fields? Can we predict distribution of magnetic 
energy in $\mathcal{l}$-modes (spherical harmonic)? Trace temporal evolution of stellar magnetic
activity cycles and polarity reversals. [among many other things]

__P1.2 Core Convection in the Presence of Magnetic Fields__

Investigate strength and topologies of magnetic fields in convection cores. Potential feedback
on stellar structure, suppression of overshoot? [IS THIS POSSIBLE?!] How does this affect the
approach to the MS? Long-term consequences for red giant asteroseismology. 

__P1.3 Magnetic Fields in Young Brown Dwarfs and Giant Planets__

Investigate how magnetic field generation is affected in cool, high pressure (degenerate) plasmas with
neutral outer layers. Is the thermal evolution of these objects affected by magnetic fields as with 
young stellar objects? Extract estimates of ohmic dissipation from dynamo models 
and account for extra heat in stellar models. [IS THIS POSSIBLE?!]

### P2. Starspots and Atmospheric Considerations
Exploring the impact of starspots on observable properties (preliminary: Feiden & Christophe, in prep). [NORDITA]
Including magnetic fields in stellar atmosphere models to better prescribe surface boundary conditions. [Uppsala]

### P3. Fundamental Properties of Young Stars
Confronting model predictions of young star properties as a function of age using a large number of stars characterized with spectro-bolometric techniques (CALYPSO) and young eclipsing binaries observed by Kepler/K2. [Hawaii; UT Austin]

### P4. Homogeneous Ages for Young Stellar Associations
Deriving homoegenous ages for young stellar associations using available literature data. Provides constraints on a number of interesting astrophysical phenomena. [partially with UT Austin; Stockholm]

## Preliminary Results
  - Feiden (2016, submitted). Identification of magnetic fields as culprit for age discrepancies.
  - Pilot study for the Sun (and low-mass star?).
  - Feiden & Christophe (in preparation). Parametrized model of starspots.
  - Stars characterized for CALYPSO.

## Independent Lines of Research
  - CALYPSO: second avenue of research is characterizing planets around young stars. 
    Feiden (PI) provides a comprehensive analysis of host stars using stellar models
    to give stellar mass, age, and distance estimates with realistic uncertainties.
  - 4MOST Internal Working Group 7 -- _Galactic Analysis Pipeline_ -- providing stellar
    structure and atmosphere code for self-consistent determination of atmospheric 
    parameters, mass, and ages for over 1 million stars.
